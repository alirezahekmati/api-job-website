### this is a job search website I have used  two APIs:
- adzona: [adzona]
- geoplugin: [geoplugin]

### more in-depth:
the website has 2 types of search :
 1. basic search 
 2. advance search
in basic search, it's going to use your IP address and  show local job 
while in advance you can choose the country manually.

basic search:

advance search:
<img  alt="website picture" src="./advanceSearch.PNG" style="padding:10px;" />
